VS2010
Open the <project>_vc10.sln file and go.

VS2012
Open the <project>_vc10.sln file
You will be prompted to upgrade the project, choose YES
After the upgrade, go.

VS2013
Open the <project>.sln file and go.

VS2015
Open the <project>.sln file
You will be prompted to upgrade the project, choose YES
After the upgrade, go.

The reason that I do not provide individual VS .sln files is that the VST3 SDK's "base" project does not include the additional Visual Studio files and must be ugraded manually via Visual Studio (thus the prompts for upgrades in VS2012 and VS2015)

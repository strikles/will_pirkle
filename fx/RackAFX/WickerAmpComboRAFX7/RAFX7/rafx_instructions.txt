To install and play with this demo project:

The <ProjectFolder> is the folder that accompanies this .txt file. It includes the complete RackAFX Project and source code.

Drop the entire folder into your RackAFX Projects folder (in RackAFX use File -> Open Projects Folder). 

Open the project by navigating to the .PRJ file in the Project Folder. The Visual Studio project file is
setup for VS2015. If using a later version, either choose YES when asked to upgrade/retarget the project, 
or right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose "Retarget Projects" (note that some versions
of Visual Studio do NOT have this option - it is a bug in Visual Studio). If necessary, manually upgrade compiler
version in Project Properties.
